## About the Project

Cru Uncorked needed a clean and elegant digital presence that would compliment their authentic French dining experience. My role in this project was designing and developing the website. The goal was to capture the aesthetic of the restaurant, using high-quality photography of the food and the architecture. The website features a custom OpenTable integration for handling reservations, a secure PayPal Checkout solution for selling gift cards, and a dynamically populated wine list that that sources data directly from their inventory.

I completed this project while working at Nesnadny + Schwartz.
