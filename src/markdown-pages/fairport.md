## About the Project

Fairport Wealth came to Nesnadny + Schwartz in need of a rebrand and a completely new website. One of the limitations of the project was that the website had to be built by their in-house development team using a proprietary content management system. We provided them with high fidelity mockups, a static prototype and a modular front-end system that can be applied to their CMS templates.

My role in this project was creating the static prototype, breaking it down into a collection of modules and templates, and packaging everything into a nicely documented GitHub repository.

Having no knowledge of the technology stack the back-end developers were using, I wrote the code samples in a language-agnostic syntax in addition to HTML in order to define areas of dynamic content.
