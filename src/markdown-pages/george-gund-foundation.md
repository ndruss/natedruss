## About the Project

The George Gund Foundation is a private, nonprofit organization focused on human well-being and the progress of society. While working at [Nesnadny + Schwartz](https://nsideas.com), I was tasked with building their new website and developing a system that would enable it to be easily reskinned on a yearly basis to reflect the foundation’s current primary focus. In order to make this possible, I created two [WordPress themes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development)—a parent theme which included all the core styles and functionality, and a [child theme](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/) that could be swapped out for a new one each year.
